        <h1>THE ROLE OF CULTURAL IN THE CREATION OF A

            <p>Abstract:This paper discusses the importance that cultural heritage has for Norwegians of Turkish<br>
                decent when it comes to negotiating both their belonging and the concept of home.The role of heritage
                in<br>
                making and crossing the boundaries of ethnicity is also discussed here.I argue that Norwegian Turks
                have<br>
                developed a multi-layered sense of belonging based on the identification with groups and places
                located<br>
                both in Turkey and in Norway. They participate in Norwegian society while identifying themselves as<br>
                Turks and negotiatons of cultural heritage contribute to the preservation of consistent image of<br>
                themselves as they adopt common Norwegian lifestyles.</p>
