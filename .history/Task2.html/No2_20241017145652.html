        <h1>THE ROLE OF CULTURAL IN THE CREATION OF A

            <p>Abstract:This paper discusses the importance that cultural heritage has for Norwegians of Turkish
                decent when it comes to negotiating both their belonging and the concept of home.The role of heritage
                in< making and crossing the boundaries of ethnicity is also discussed here.I argue that Norwegian Turks
                    have< developed a multi-layered sense of belonging based on the identification with groups and
                    places located both in Turkey and in Norway. They participate in Norwegian society while identifying
                    themselves as Turks and negotiatons of cultural heritage contribute to the preservation of
                    consistent image of themselves as they adopt common Norwegian lifestyles.</p>
