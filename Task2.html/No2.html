    <h1>THE ROLE OF CULTURAL HERITAGE IN THE CREATION OF A
        SENSE OF BELONGING AMONG NORWEGIAN TURKS:
        BOUNDARY MAKING AND CROSSING
    </h1>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>This paper discusses the importance that cultural heritage has for Norwegians
        of Turkish
        decent when it comes to negotiating both their belonging and the concept of home.The role of heritage
        in making and crossing the boundaries of ethnicity is also discussed here.I argue that Norwegian Turks
        have developed a multi-layered sense of belonging based on the identification with groups and
        places located both in Turkey and in Norway. They participate in Norwegian society while identifying
        themselves as Turks and negotiations of cultural heritage contribute to the preservation of
        consistent image of themselves as they adopt common Norwegian lifestyles.</p>
